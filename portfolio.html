    <div class="about-sub">
        <h2 class="sub-head">Background</h2>
        <p>
            Born and raised in Wallasey, my education strongly focused on Mathematics and I.T.
            For my A-levels I studied Math and Further Maths which covered all types of mathematics. 
            These are; algera, statistics, mechanics and decision maths.
            I also studied I.T which covered basic web design, animation and several other projects
            <br><br>
            After completing my A levels I went to Liverpool John Moores University to study Applied mathematics.
            This degree covered advanced algebra, statistics, business opertions, basic computer programming and developed my professional skills for the work environment.
            I studied for 3 years graduating in July 2019 and a few weeks later joined Code Nation's master coding course.
            <br><br>
            Code Nation deleved deeper into coding, teaching the front and back end predominantly in Javascript.
            Here I learnt not just the coding but several other skills which forged me into a technical professional.
        </p>

    <div class="about-sub">
        <h2 class="sub-head">Why Coding?</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned, whilst studying at John Moores University one of my modules was simple computer programming in Matlab. 
            It was always the module that stuck with me and I have always had an interest in coding. 
            My A levels show this having a C in Mathematics but earning a Distinction* in IT.
            I enjoy the challenges coding gives me and enjoy working on projects from planning how to create it to writing the code and testing it. 
            Another reason I love coding is that it is always evolving meaning there is always something new and exciting to learn.
            I enjoy researching in my free time finding newer and more efficient ways to improve my code.
        </p>

    <div class="about-sub">
        <h2 class="sub-head">Looking for?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm looking for a full stack developer role at junior level. 
            <br><br>
            I live in Wallasey and want to work within the north west region.

                    In this module I learnt the basic syntax used in computer programming using Matlab.
                    This was were I first learnt to use for loops and if statements along with other basic fundamentals.
                    In matlab I learnt to create graphs using arrays as the data.

                    For my dissertation I wanted to learn more about computing.
                    So I studied the history of computers from the 17th century to today.
                    More specifically computer architecture and its evolution through the years.
                    The history of computers is very closely linked to mathematics as the word computer originally meant a mathematician (or someone who performs computations).

                    Such as critical path analysis, the transportation simplex algorithm and calculating stock.
                    This was a very useful module.

                    This module was split in two.
                    First it taught the analysis of data on the more variable and testing a hypothesis.
                    Second the extraction of usuable data. This module stook with me as it introduced Rstudio.
                    A programming software that produced statistical output.

                    An example of problem solving I love doing is when a team member asks for help on their code.
                    When it fails to run I love analysing it to spot the problem and coming up with a solution.
