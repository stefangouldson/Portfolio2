        <p class="commentary">
            Given the sounds by codenation, I designed a page with labelled buttons.
            These buttons would play the drumkit when clicked or the corrosponding key was pressed.

        <p class="commentary">
            What Code Nation calls the Infamous Dice Game.
            The game is to roll a dice and get a total score over 21.
            However if the player rolls a one they lose.
            This game was made for both single player or multiplayer.

            This was the employer project from Code Nation. 
            In a team of 9 we were given a brief from Special Needs Care to design a rota app.
            The brief specifically asked for the staff sign in to take the member to either the admin or staff page.
            Staff page simply displayed the users shifts for that day.
            Admin however saw all the shifts for all staff members and have the ability to add shifts and delete them.
            I was voted one of two team leader for which I was responsible for the back-end functionality.
            I helped make the server, endpoints and functions to communicate with the database.
            As a team leader I assigned roles within the team and ensured they met the requirements, checked for accuracy, chaired team meetings and ensured all elements were delivered on time.
